  I didn't go outside of <span class="cities">Catalunya</span> for the first 5 years. I was so busy settling myself in Barcelona to get a resident card became legal , it was not easy especially when you are an immigrant and you have family back in your country to support it makes it more difficult. Well I managed to start saving some money and my first trip was The Netherlands and it changed my life. I wanted more, that's how my journey starts !

<h2 id="holland">The Netherlands</h2>

<p>My school friend who lives in <span class="cities">Amsterdam</span> visited me in June 2018. I showed him Barcelona. We had a great time and fun. He invited me to Amsterdam. I could not resist , so I finally visited him the same year in October . We had one more friend from Germany. It was a 4 days trip. Our first day we hung out in Amsterdam , It was so fun and the best start of the trip. Most interesting and surprising fact about Amsterdam is it is a city of museums , <strong>it's a heaven for people who love museums. You can spend the whole week just<a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_museums_in_Amsterdam"> visiting them.</a></strong></p>

<p>We visited <span class="cities">Den Haag</span> , which is a beautiful city. We wanted to do  bungee jumps but it was a windy day and they were closed. Then i decided to walk on the beach but damn because wind , sand was everywhere in my mouth , hair even in pockets yup it was a <storng>bad decision.</strong> <span class="cities">Rotterdam</span> is a magnificent city. This city makes you wonder if you are in the future. I love the Netherlands. I will visit again but next time I will carry my umbrella because weather is unpredictable and it's always raining there , so you have to mentaly prepare for that. I am surprised that in Amsterdam almost <strong>everyone speaks english it's a huge benefit for travelers.</strong>

<h2 id="swi-flag">Switzerland</h2>

<p>In June we did a <span class="countries">Switzerland</span> trip. My friends and I gathered in <span class="cities">Geneva</span>. I flew from <span class="cities">Barcelona</span> and my friend from <span class="cities">Amsterdam</span> drove all the way to Geneva. It was a 17 hours drive. Our third friend was already there. Geneva is a diplomatic city. I thought Geneva was the capital but nope. Bern is the capital I was not expecting but <span class="cities">Bern</span> is beautiful capital city. Its nature surprised you, it felt like heaven but it's just a beginning.</p>

<p>Switzerland surprised me Words are not enough, it was Magic ! we continued and our next stop was <span class="cities">Lucerne</span> ,<strong> we celebrated my friend's birthday on <a target="_blank" href="https://livingnomads.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/22/lucerne-lakelucerne-travel-blog-4.jpg">Lucerne Lake</a>,</strong> it was the best birthday celebration ever, we did swimming after. <em class="cities">Interlaken</em> is the winner ! you will find your thrill adventure fun and peace. We wind up our trip and <em class="cities">Zurich</em> was our last stop. <strong>We did  couchsurfing and it was a wonderful experience</strong> knowing locals and learning about their culture and cities. It was a huge help and no doubt they are big hearted and <strong>wonderful hosts.</strong></p>
